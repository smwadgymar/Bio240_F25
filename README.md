# Bio240_F25

This is the online repository of course materials for Bio240, Biostatistics for Life Scientists.

Here, RStudio operates in your browser. Your workspace is unique to you - all of your files will automatically save as you go and you can also save any scripts or files you generate in your online workspace. You can access RStudio by using the link at the top of the Moodle page.

Important reminders:

1. The first thing you should do when you start working on a project or exercise is to set your working directory to the folder that stores or will store the appropriate files. You can do this by looking at the lower right window in RStudio, selecting the drop down menu called "More", and selecting "Set As Working Directory". This tells R that the files you need are stored in this folder and that the files you create (like scripts, graphs, or RMarkdown files) should also be stored in this folder. Make this a habit.

2. After you have set your working directory (reminder #1), you can import the relevant CSV file from the working directory into R using the code read.csv("datafilename.csv").

3. To start a new R Markdown file, go to the top right portion of your RStudio screen, click on the icon of a blank page with a plus sign, and select "R Markdown". Give your page an appropriate name and select the output as "PDF". You can add code chunks as you go by clicking on the icon of a green circle with a "c" in the middle.

4. To generate a PDF file of your work (as you will need to when you submit your work to me on Moodle), click on the drop down menu next to the "Knit" button with the yarn icon and select "Knit to PDF". You will see the PDF appear in the working directory that you set (see Reminder #1). In the bottom right portion of your RStudio screen, you can click on the white box to the left of the PDF file, click on the "More" button with the gear icon, and select "Export" to save the file to your computer.

5. Like me, many of you might leave tabs open in your browser for weeks (or months...) at a time. In the case of your RStudio workspace, it would help if you got in the habit of ending your work session when you're done by clicking on "File" and selecting "Quit Session". This is to ensure that you can access any additional files that I add to the repository. Refreshing your browser tab won't sync things - you will have to click on the link at the top of the Moodle page to launch RStudio each time. SEE REMINDER #6 FOR HOW TO SAVE FILES WHEN YOU QUIT YOUR SESSION

6. When you close a script/RMarkdown file, you should save first by going to File and selecting Save. If you try to close the file without saving first, RStudio will prompt you to save. Keep in mind we are talking about saving INDIVIDUAL FILES. However, when you quit the PROGRAM, RStudio will ask you if you want to save your workspace. Your workspace includes every named item, variable, and dataset, plus your coding history, including all of your errors. YOU DO NOT WANT TO SAVE YOUR WORKSPACE. Imagine working on ten different exercises and saving your workspace each time. You would have a huge accumulation of random variables and datasets that have nothing to do with each other. What a mess! You can recreate your items by running your script again next time you log in. There is no need to save your workspace. Say it outloud: THERE IS NO NEED TO SAVE YOUR WORKSPACE.

7. ANNOTATE YOUR CODE. Annotate everything using #s. Your future self will thank you for your thorough and consise notes, but also, I assess your notes just as much as I do your code. ANNOTATE EVERYTHIIIIIINNNNNGGGGGG.

8. Have fun! Stats and coding can be intimidating in the beginning. However, I swear that with practice, you will feel like a powerful weilder of data, a master of data viz, a coder extraordinaire! I believe in you. You believe in you too.
